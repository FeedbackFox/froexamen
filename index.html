She's a 34-year-old, married to well-known youtuber Egorapper (Arin Berhow). Arin plays a lot of retro games on his youtube channel with his partner Danny, which only encouraged Suzy's hobby for retro gaming. She started gaming fairly early into her life, growing up with an SNES that she played a hell of a lot of Super Metroid on. She has managed to keep the SNES running ever since, and its remained one of her favorite consoles of all time. This is why she had decided to start Retro Games Arcade - Spreading the joy. She hopes to be able to reach as many people as possible with this website, so that everyone can enjoy their childhood games, or even start getting interested in older games in the first place.</p>

                        <p class="home-p">"Lorem ipsum but I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
